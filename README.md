# Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
This repo contains code for a sample platform which includes:
1. API - with various GET methods accessible based on the current User's Role
1. CLI - a console app calling the API with no user intervention, such as an IOT device
1. SPA - a GatsbyJS site which shows components based on the current User's Role
